"""PB6 base box.

An open-top rectangular box with its side walls at +-y removed: a floor and
the two end walls at +-x, all one wall thickness, open at the top and along
both long sides. Four variables drive it: l, b, h and wall. The floor is
flat, with no battery ribs: the six-cell 18650 pack from the parts library
(battery_holders/pack_3x2) sits on it against the back wall.
The front wall has two holes for USB-A plugs, in line with the ports of the
two IP6505 fast-charge boards that sit side by side on the floor behind it,
and a hole for a USB-C plug, in line with the port of the CN3302 battery
charger beside them.
Four rectangular pillars stand on the floor, two at each end of the pack,
one under each of its end strips' tabs, with the tab's footprint; each has
two tapped holes in line with the tab's, for M1.2 screws that fix the pack.

Assumptions where the description is silent:
- l, b and h are the outside dimensions; the space between the end walls is
  l - 2 wall long and h - wall deep, and runs the full breadth b;
- the floor is as thick as the walls;
- l = 120, h = 50 and wall = 3 mm until real sizes are given; b is the
  pack's breadth (63 mm), read from pack_3x2, so the box is as wide as the
  pack and its open sides are flush with the pack's;
- the box is centred on the z axis and stands on z = 0, with l along x and b
  along y; corners are sharp;
- l grows from 120 to 130 mm to take the pack, which is about 15 mm longer
  than the four loose cells were;
- the pack's back end (the tips of its end strip's tabs) is against the back
  wall (-x); its size comes from pack_3x2 through load_library;
- the first IP6505 board sits on the floor, centred across the breadth, its
  USB port's mouth against the inside of the front wall (+x); the second sits
  beside it on the -y side, 3 mm away, the same way round; each plug hole is
  the USB-A plug's 12 x 4.5 mm metal shell with 0.5 mm clearance all round
  (13 x 5.5 mm), square-cornered, centred on its port, so the plug's moulded
  body stays outside; the board's size and port height come from
  power/ip6505_charger through load_library;
- the CN3302 charger board sits on the floor beside the first IP6505, on the
  +y side with a 3 mm gap between the boards, its USB-C port's mouth against the inside of
  the front wall too; its plug hole is the USB-C plug's 8.25 x 2.4 mm shell
  with 0.5 mm clearance all round (9.25 x 3.4 mm), with fully rounded ends
  like the plug, centred on the port; the board's size and port height come
  from power/cn3302_charger through load_library;
- the pillars stand on the floor and reach the tabs' undersides (15 mm),
  so each tab rests on its pillar; each pillar's top is the tab's
  footprint, from the holders' end face out to the tab's tip (4.9 x 10 mm);
  the back pillars meet the back wall, which the back tabs touch;
- the pillars' holes are M1.2 tap holes, 0.95 mm, 5 mm deep (as in the
  holder body): a 6 mm screw through the 1.5 mm tab reaches 4.5 mm in and
  forms its thread there; the thread is not modelled;
